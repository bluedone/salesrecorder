# salesrecorder
This is my project for pop-up stall to record and manage their item, get calculate sale and profit by using web application.

Key Features:
  - Log In/ Log out
  - Sales Recorder (how much money you recieve , what and how munh item you sell)
  - Get summary for select period
  
Why does it not include complete CRUD on this project?
  As you can see this project lack of way to create, update or delete user information, the main reason is this project original plan for 2 purpose help my mom to summarize thing up and  I can learn new language.

Note: This project is definitely not feasible in business viewpoints, feel free to try it yourself XD (My mom does not even feel comfortable to use it)
